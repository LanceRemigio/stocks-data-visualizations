# Stocks Data Visualizations

In this data project, we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. The goal of this project is not to create an in depth analysis of stock data but rather to manipulate the data using the **pandas** library and visualize the data using a combination of  **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. We'll focus on analyzing and visualizing the banks stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.
